# Customized-Profiling-Model-for-City-Traffic-Accident-Risk-Among-Drivers

Project Overview
This project aims to develop a customized profiling model for drivers to predict their risk of being involved in city traffic accidents. The project addresses a critical challenge in urban traffic safety by leveraging big data analysis and machine learning techniques to analyze diverse factors influencing accident risks. By creating a predictive model, we seek to enhance traffic safety and reduce accident rates.

Background
Traffic accidents are a significant issue in urban areas, with a large number of incidents caused by driver behavior. Considerate drivers, who adhere to traffic rules and signs, generally have lower accident risks compared to inconsiderate drivers who often disregard such rules. However, these behaviors alone are not sufficient to predict accident risk accurately. Other factors, such as road conditions, weather, and external events, also play crucial roles in determining the likelihood of accidents.

Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:

To collect and analyze data related to driver behaviors, road conditions, weather, and other relevant factors.
To preprocess the collected data, ensuring accuracy and consistency for model development.
To develop a machine learning-based predictive model that accurately assesses the risk of traffic accidents for individual drivers.


Data Collection

Data will be collected from various sources, including:

Driver behavior records (e.g., speed, adherence to traffic signals).
Vehicle information.
Road conditions and traffic data.
Weather conditions.
Historical data on traffic violations and accidents.

Model Development
The predictive model will be built using supervised learning algorithms. Key steps include:

Feature Selection: Identifying and selecting the most relevant attributes influencing accident risk.
Model Training: Using Support Vector Machine(SVM)/decision tree algorithms to train the model on the processed dataset.
